Hello. You have found my plugin. It's open source, with a very free license (unlike Stallmans horrible GPLv3). Do whatever you want to do with it, but credit me. Just a link or something.

This plugin simulates Central Line ATP in a way... Don't think signalling is working, but it has power rail gaps simulated.

ATO can be started with both HOME and END pressed, can be turned off with DELETE.
It may or may not stop for signals, not sure about that.

Installation:
Compile it with VS2010+ (or just download the probably outdated binaries), then put LU_ATS.dll into a train folder of your choice, and then change ats.cfg to LU_ATS.dll
You may need to modify your route to have it support it.

Beacon 35 specifies the speed limit in kilometres per hour.
Beacon 20 (like in os_ats1.dll) specifies the length of the power rail gap. No modification nessescary if routes already have that simulated.
Beacon 36 tells the train to slow down before a station.
